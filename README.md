# FindCash

This is an Android app which helps travelers exchange cash while travelling. It matches travellers together who have mutually compatible needs 
so that they can make an in person exchange in a safe airport terminal in a transaction free manner.

For example, say Traveler A is going from JFK to LHR and needs GBP cash and Traveler B is traveling from LHR to JFK and needs USD
cash. A and B can input their request for opposite currencey cash, along with flight timing details, and the app will match the two
together if they can feasibly meet to make the exchnage in person
